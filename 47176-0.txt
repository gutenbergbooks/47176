INTRODUCTION


THERE are various methods of introducing an artist to his public.
One of the best is to describe how you saved his life in the Bush
in '82; or he saved yours; and then you go on: "Little did either
of us anticipate in those far-off days that Fougasse was destined
to become...." Another way is to leave Fougasse out altogether, and
concentrate, how happily, on your own theories of black-and-white
drawing, or politics, or the decline of the churches; after all, an
introduction doesn't last long, and he has the rest of the book to
himself. Perhaps, however, it is kinder to keep the last paragraph for
him: "Take these little sketches by Fougasse, for instance...." and
the reader, if he cares to any longer, can then turn over and take
them. Left to ourselves, that is the method we should adopt. But the
publisher is at our elbow. "This is an introduction," he says. "For
Heaven's sake introduce the fellow."

Let us begin, then, by explaining Fougasse's nationality. I never
discuss his drawings with another, but we tell each other how
remarkable it is that a Frenchman should have such an understanding
of English sport. "Of course," we say, "in the actual drawing
the nationality reveals itself; the Gallic style stands forth
unmistakeably; only a Frenchman has just that line. But how amazingly
British is the outlook! Was there ever a Frenchman before who
understood and loved cricket as this one?" We ask ourselves how
the phenomenon is to be explained. The explanation is simple. A
fougasse--I quote the dictionary--is a small mine from six to twelve
feet underground charged either with powder or loaded shells; and if a
British sapper subaltern, severely wounded at Gallipoli, beguiles the
weary years of hospital by drawing little pictures and sending them
up to _Punch_, he may as well call himself Fougasse as anything else.
Particularly if his real name is Bird, and if a Bird, whose real name
is Yeats, is already drawing for _Punch_. Of course it would have been
simpler if they had all stuck to their own names like gentlemen, but it
is too late now to do anything about it, and when a genuine M. Fougasse
of Paris comes along, he will have to call himself Tomkins. Once the
downward path of deceit is trodden, there is seemingly no end to it.

We have our artist, then, Kenneth Bird of Morar, Inverness. When I
first met him at the beginning of 1919, he was just out of hospital,
swinging slowly along with the aid of a pair of rocking-horse crutches.
This was on his annual journey south, for they have the trains in Morar
now. Once a year Fougasse makes the great expedition to London, to
see what the latest fashions may be, and is often back in Morar again
before they have changed to something later. I have seen him each year;
in 1920 with two ordinary crutches; in 1921 with two sticks; in 1922
with one stick; perhaps by 1923 he will be playing again the games of
which he makes such excellent fun. But, selfishly, we cannot regret the
Turkish bullet, which turned what I suspect of being quite an ordinary
engineer into such an individual black-and-white draughtsman.

I am really the last person who should be writing this introduction,
for all drawing is to me a mystery. When I put two dots, a horizontal
line and a vertical line into a circle, the result is undoubtedly
a face, but whose, or what expressing, I cannot tell you until
afterwards, nor always then. But these mystery men can definitely
promise you beforehand that their dot-and-line juggling will represent
Contempt or Surprise or Mr. Asquith, just as you want it. It is very
strange; and, sometimes I think, not quite fair. However, this is not
the place wherein to dwell upon the injustice of it. What I wanted to
say was that with Fougasse I feel a little more at ease than usual;
we have something in common. Accepting the convention that writers
write exclusively with the pen, and that black-and-white artists draw
exclusively with the pencil, I should describe Fougasse as more nearly
a Brother of the Pen than any of the others. Were I in the _Punch_
office now, I should never begin my weekly contribution until his
drawing had turned up, lest it should prove that he had already written
it for me; and he, I like to tell myself, would be equally fearful lest
that very week I might have got his drawing into type. "The Tragedy of
a Trouser," for instance--it is a whole article. Any wide-awake Trade
Union would forbid it.

But it is Fougasse's golf and cricket articles of which, as a rival
practitioner, I should have complained most; in which, Plancus no
longer consul, I delight most. Turn to page 31 and you will see all
that is to be said on the subject of village cricket. How lucky these
draughtsmen are! What a laborious business we others should have made
of it! Would any of you have laughed at our wordy description of the
fielder in a cloth cap to whom one can run a single? "But one gets in
two for trousers tucked into socks"--"stretching it to three for a
straw hat"--"and four for a black waistcoat." Each fielder as drawn
here is a joy. Yet there is something more than that; we are not just
laughing at them, for they are our friends. We look from one to the
other of them, and gradually the smile becomes a little wistful. It
was how many years ago? Now the printed page has vanished, and we see
again the village green. Straw Hat was the postman. Not quite like
that, however, for he wore the official trousers with it, but he moved
slowly, being the postman and tired of it, and one ran three to him.
Black Waistcoat was the dairy farmer; his the cows which had to be
driven off the pitch on a Saturday morning; a mighty underhand bowler,
bouncing terribly. Fougasse is wrong here, for his hands could stop
anything, and one would never run four to him. I doubt if you would
ever run four to a black waistcoat, their hands are so big. Slow in the
return of course, but safe, safe.

You may think that you have had enough of War Sketches, but you will
be glad to see the historic "Gadgets" again, and perhaps even now
"1914-1918" will give you a lump in the throat with your smile, and
make you somehow a little more proud. It is so very much England. But,
taking the drawings as a whole, I should say that the charm of their
humour lies in the fact that they make the very jokes which we should
have made for ourselves, if only we had realized that they were jokes.
When Mr. Bateman gives us his brilliant life-study of the man who
breathed on the glass in the British Museum, we realize that this is an
inspiration far outside our range. "However did he think of it?" we say
to ourselves in awe. When Mr. Morrow draws us "a little supper-party at
the Borgias," we have to admit sadly that the comedy of a supper-party
at the Borgias would never have occurred to _us_. But when Fougasse
describes to us his feelings in the presence of the Wedding Detective,
or the conversation of the Club Bore in the library, then we beam upon
him delightedly. Why, it's absolutely true! We've noticed it ourselves
a hundred times! As we were saying to Jones only yesterday----Alas we
flatter ourselves. We saw the pebbles lying there, day after day, and
there, for us, they would still be lying. But a humorist picks them up
and holds them this way and that. The light shines upon them. See! They
are precious stones.

AFTER ALL, BE INDUCED TO BUY IT AS A RECREATION-GROUND, AND NO ONE
MAKES A BETTER OFFER) IS WILLING TO SELL THE GROUND TO CARRY THE HOUSE
THAT JACK WANTS BUILT.

HIS DESIGNS FOR THE NEW TOWN HALL, THE PROPOSED COUNTY HOSPITAL,
THE CATHEDRAL EXTENSION, THE BOROUGH POWER STATION AND THE
DRINKING-FOUNTAIN, AND PROVIDED THAT NO MORE IMPORTANT COMMISSION TURNS
UP) IS GOING TO DESIGN THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE GROUND OF THE LANDOWNER

SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COUNTY COUNCIL, PARISH COUNCIL, CENTRAL
HOUSING AUTHORITY, MINISTRY OF HEALTH, BOARD OF AGRICULTURE, MINISTRY
OF TRANSPORT, CONGESTED DISTRICTS BOARD, AND ANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS
INTERESTED, EITHER NOW IN EXISTENCE OR CONTEMPLATED FOR THE FUTURE) IS
GOING TO INSPECT, REVISE, AMEND, AND POSITIVELY FINALLY APPROVE THE
DESIGNS OF THE ARCHITECT AND SURVEYOR WHO....

ALLOWS HIM, AND THAT HE CAN GET THE MATERIALS, WHICH IS DOUBTFUL, AND
THE MEN, WHICH IS HARDLY PROBABLE, AND THE PRICE, WHICH IS PRACTICALLY
OUT OF THE QUESTION) IS GOING TO CARRY OUT THE DESIGNS, AS FINALLY

CONGESTION ON THE LINE WILL POSSIBLY BE EASIER LATER, AND THAT THE
SUPPLY OF GOODS WAGONS IS VERY CONSIDERABLY AUGMENTED, AND THAT NEW
LOOPS AND SIDINGS NOT YET SUGGESTED WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO RELIEVE THE
PRESSURE, AND THAT A REORGANISATION OF THE RAILWAY STAFF DOES NOT MOVE
HIM ELSEWHERE, AS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAPPEN) HAS PROMISED TO DO
HIS BEST TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSPORT OF THE NECESSARY MATERIALS TO THE
BUILDING CONTRACTOR WHO....

THIS IS THE MERCHANT WHO (IF PRICES ARE LEFT ENTIRELY TO HIS DISCRETION
AND TIME IS OF NO IMPORTANCE, AND IF HE FINDS THAT, AFTER ALL, IT IS
TO HIS ADVANTAGE TO SELL IN THIS COUNTRY RATHER THAN TO EXPORT, AND
IF HE DOESN'T RETIRE IN THE MEANTIME, AS HE IS THINKING OF DOING) HAS
CONSENTED TO TRY TO SEND MATERIALS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE RAILWAY
OFFICIAL WHO....

THESE ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUILDING TRADES WHO (IF ALL
MATTERS IN DISPUTE ARE SATISFACTORILY SETTLED BY THAT TIME, AND
PROVIDED THAT THEY CAN ALL GET THEIR OWN HOUSES SITED, DESIGNED,
PASSED, CONTRACTED FOR, SUPPLIED AND BUILT FIRST) ARE GOING TO ERECT

    THE UNSPEAKABLE CRIME--
    OF--
    MISSING ONE--
    WHILE FIELDING SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR OPPONENTS.

CONSOLATION]

[Illustration: _Fair Partner:_ "One always meets so many interesting
people here that i get quite confused. Now tell me, which Mr. Jones are
you?"

_Jones:_ "Me? Oh, i'm only the Jones who's invited to brighten up a
dull party."]

[Illustration:

    "HORACE, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BOILER. SHALL I GET THE
           PLUMBER?"

   "PLUMBER? OF COURSE NOT--
    I'LL PUT IT RIGHT.
    JUST GET ME A SPANNER--
    AND A HAMMER--
    AND A LADDER--
    AND SOME STRING--
    AND A WOODEN PLUG OR TWO--
    AND AS MANY TOWELS AS YOU CAN FIND--
    AND ALL THE BLANKETS IN THE HOUSE--
    AND--
    THE DOCTOR."

THE MAN WHO COULD DO IT HIMSELF]

[Illustration: _Tactful Shopwalker (to lady who seems to have got into
the rough with her umbrella):_ "Excuse me, Madam, but would you not
prefer to have them sent for you?"]

[Illustration: SMITH, WITH SURPRISING GOOD FORTUNE, PICKED UP AN ALMOST
INDUBITABLY GENUINE OLD SATSUMA BOWL FOR 7_s._ 6_d._

<sc>_Pipkin on Pottery_ (21_s._ NET) CONFIRMED HIS BELIEF.

WHICH WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY GRUBMANN'S _ORIENTAL
PORCELAINS_ (£3 14_s._ 6_d._ WITH POSTAGE);

WHILE MUTT'S _CERAMICS_ (15 VOLS. £20 CARRIAGE PAID) PUT THE MATTER
PRACTICALLY BEYOND DOUBT.

A VISIT TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM (TAXIS 7_s._),

AND ANOTHER TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM (MORE TAXIS 9_s._ 6_d._; LUNCH 11_s._
3_d._) INCREASED HIS CONVICTION;

AND FINALLY HIS FRIEND HARDPASTE, THE EXPERT, WHOM HE ASKED TO DINNER
(INCLUDING WINES AND CIGARS £4 18_s._ 6_d._) TO VIEW THE PIECE,

SET THE SEAL ON HIS TRIUMPH BY DECLARING IT UNQUESTIONABLY AUTHENTIC
AND WORTH (IN THE PROPER QUARTER, OF COURSE) QUITE DOUBLE WHAT HE GAVE
FOR IT.

THE BARGAIN]

[Illustration: UNFORTUNATE OVERSIGHT ON THE PART OF A PRACTITIONER
CALLED AWAY FROM HIS CHILDREN'S PARTY TO ATTEND A PATIENT IN HIS
CONSULTING-ROOM.]

[Illustration: "H'M, YES--I FEAR WE MUST KNOCK OFF TOBACCO."

"CERTAINLY. I NEVER SMOKE."

"AND ALCOHOL ALSO, I'M AFRAID."

"BY ALL MEANS. I'M A TEETOTALER."

"STRONG TEA AND COFFEE ARE EQUALLY POISONOUS, BEAR IN MIND."

"RATHER. I NEVER TOUCH THEM."

"NO SUGAR OR SWEET THINGS, REMEMBER!"

"EXCELLENT! I DETEST 'EM."

"A MEAT DIET STRICTLY FORBIDDEN!!"

"SPLENDID. I'M A VEGETARIAN."

"A COLD BATH EVERY MORNING!!!"

"GLORIOUS. I ALWAYS HAVE ONE."

"AND G-GO AWAY FOR A LONG BRACING CHANGE TO THE B-BLEAKEST PART OF THE
EAST COAST...."

"PRICELESS. WHY, MY DEAR OLD FELLOW--

"I LIVE THERE."
